# great-integrator-bake-off
## What a privilege and honour to be part of three months of research in a remote tent

### Aims:
There are 4-5 integrators that everyone uses in Solar System dynamics that have never been fully compared and tested:
* OpenOrb
* FindOrb
* OrbFit
* JPL Horizons
* ADAM

Weâ€™d like to create an automated piece of code that propagates asteroids using all these integrators, compares their outputs, and presents it in some visually understandable way (e.g., a red-yellow-green matrix w. the asteroid on the Y axis and the integrator on the X axis).

More documentation will appear relative to completion rate.
